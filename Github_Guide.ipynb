    "### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)\n",
    "1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)\n",
    "2. Click \"Sign up\" and follow the instructions\n",

    "## Part 2: Installing Git (First-time setup only)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Windows:\n",
    "1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)\n",
    "2. Run the installer with default settings\n",
    "3. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (search for it in Start menu)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Mac:\n",
    "1. Open **Terminal** (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)\n",
    "2. Type: `git --version` and press Enter\n",

    "## Part 3: Configuring Git (One-time setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and run:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Part 3.5: Setting Up Authentication (REQUIRED!)\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations. You need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Personal Access Token:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into GitHub\n",
    "2. Click your profile picture (top-right) > **Settings**\n",
    "3. Scroll down and click **Developer settings** (bottom of left sidebar)\n",
    "4. Click **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**\n",
    "5. Click **Generate new token** > **Generate new token (classic)**\n",
    "6. Give it a name (e.g., \"Laptop Token for ECH6845\")\n",
    "7. Set expiration (choose 90 days or custom)\n",
    "8. Check these permissions:\n",
    "   - ✓ **repo** (all repo permissions)\n",
    "9. Scroll down and click **Generate token**\n",
    "10. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately! You won't see it again\n",
    "11. Save it somewhere safe (password manager or secure note)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Your Token:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First time pushing/pulling**, Git will ask for credentials:\n",
    "- **Username**: Your GitHub username\n",
    "- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Cache Your Credentials (Easier for Students)\n",
    "\n",
    "After entering your token once, save it:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global credential.helper wincred\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global credential.helper store\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the next time you push/pull, enter your username and token once—it'll be saved automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4: Cloning the Repository to Your Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your GitHub repository page\n",
    "2. Click the green **\"Code\"** button\n",
    "3. Copy the HTTPS URL (it looks like: `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`)\n",
    "4. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux)\n",
    "5. Navigate to where you want the project folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd Documents\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. Clone the repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "7. Move into your project folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd repository-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Part 5: Creating and Saving Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: Launch Jupyter from Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "1. Open **Anaconda Navigator**\n",
    "2. Click **\"Launch\"** under Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "3. Navigate to your cloned repository folder\n",
    "4. Click **\"New\"** > **\"Python 3\"** to create a notebook\n",

    "6. Work on your project and **save frequently** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Launch Jupyter from Command Line\n",
    "1. In **Anaconda Prompt/Terminal**, navigate to your repository folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd path/to/repository-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Launch Jupyter:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Your browser will open with Jupyter\n",
    "4. Create and save your notebook as above\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 6: Uploading Your Notebook to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've saved your Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Check What Changed\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows which files have been added or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Add Your Files\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "This stages all changed files. Or add specific files:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add your-notebook.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Commit Your Changes\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add analysis notebook\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write a clear message describing what you added/changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Push to GitHub\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Note: Some repositories use `master` instead of `main`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Verify on GitHub\n",
    "Go to your GitHub repository page and refresh—your notebook should appear!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 7: Working as a Team (Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before You Start Working:\n",
    "Always pull the latest changes first:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### After You Finish Working:\n",
    "1. Save your notebook\n",
    "2. Add, commit, and push your changes (Steps 1-4 above)\n",
    "\n",
    "### If Multiple People Edit the Same File:\n",
    "- **Communicate** with your team about who's working on what\n",
    "- Consider creating **separate notebooks** for different team members\n",
    "- Use **branches** for more advanced workflows (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: \"Invalid username or token\" or \"Authentication failed\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: You need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password (see Part 3.5 above)\n",
    "- Make sure you're pasting the token, not your GitHub password\n",
    "- Check that your token hasn't expired\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: \"Permission denied\" when pushing\n",
    "- **Solution**: Make sure you've been added as a collaborator and accepted the invitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: \"Merge conflict\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Pull the latest changes first with `git pull`, resolve conflicts, then push\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Can't find Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "- **Solution**: Search for \"Anaconda Prompt\" in Windows Start menu, or use regular Terminal/Command Prompt after activating conda\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Jupyter notebook won't open in the right folder\n",
    "- **Solution**: Make sure you navigate to the repository folder using `cd` before launching Jupyter\n",
